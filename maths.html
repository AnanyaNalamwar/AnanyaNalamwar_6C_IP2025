<p><mark>Shakuntala Devi: The Human Computer
Shakuntala Devi (1929-2013) was an Indian mathematician, mental calculator, and writer. She was nicknamed the "Human Computer" for her exceptional ability to perform complex mathematical calculations in her mind.</mark>

<br><h4>*Early Life and Career*</h4>
Born on 4 November 1929 in Bangalore, India, Shakuntala began demonstrating her mathematical prowess at a young age. She was self-taught and never received formal education. Her father, a circus performer, recognized her talent and  left the circus and took her on road shows that displayed her ability at calculation. At the age of six she demonstrated her arithmetic abilities at the University of Mysore.
<br>In 1944, Devi moved to London, United Kingdom.Devi returned to India in the mid-1960s, and she married Paritosh Banerji, an officer of the Indian Administrative Service from Kolkata.

<br><h4>Mental calculator</h4>
<br>Devi travelled to several countries around the world, demonstrating her arithmetic talents. She was on a tour of Europe throughout 1950 and was in New York City in 1976.
 In 1988, she travelled to the US to have her abilities studied by Arthur Jensen, a professor of educational psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. Jensen tested her performance at several tasks, including calculating large numbers. Examples of the problems presented to Devi included calculating the cube root of 61,629,875 and the seventh root of 170,859,375. Jensen reported that Devi provided the solution to the above-mentioned problems (395 and 15, respectively) before Jensen could copy them down in his notebook.
<h5>Jensen published his findings in the academic journal Intelligence in 1990.</h5>

<br>In 1977, at Southern Methodist University,<mark> she computed the 23rd root of a 201-digit number in 50 seconds.</mark> Her answer, 546,372,891, was confirmed by calculations done at the US Bureau of Standards using the UNIVAC 1101 computer, for which a special program had to be written to perform such a large calculation. <mark>It took the UNIVAC computer 62 seconds to produce the correct answer.</mark>

<br>On 18 June 1980, she demonstrated the multiplication of two 13-digit numbers 
The Department of Computing at Imperial College London randomly picked these numbers. <h5>She correctly answered in 28 seconds. This event was recorded in the 1982 Guinness Book of World Records.</h5>Writer Steven Smith commented, <mark>"the result is so far superior to anything previously reported that it can only be described as unbelievable."</mark>

<br>Shakuntala Devi explained many of the methods she used to do mental calculations in her 1977 book Figuring: The Joy of Numbers.


<br><h4>Awards and Honors</h4>
<br>1. <mark>*Ramanujan Mathematical Award*:</mark> Received the Ramanujan Mathematical Award in 1988.
<br>2. <mark>*Honorary Doctorate*:</mark> Awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Mysore.
<br>3. <mark>*Recognition by Indian Government*: </mark>Recognized by the Indian government for her contributions to mathematics and education.

<br><h5>4. Set multiple Guinness World Records for mental calculations, including multiplying two 13-digit numbers in 28 seconds.
<br>5.Authored several books on mathematics, puzzles, and astrology.
<br>6.Demonstrated her abilities on various international platforms, including the BBC and CBS.</h5>

<br><h4>*Legacy*</h4>
<br>Shakuntala Devi's remarkable abilities and contributions to mathematics have inspired generations. Her legacy continues to motivate people to develop their mental calculation skills and appreciate the beauty of mathematics.
